# mindbox 
![](public/ic_launcher.png)

A MindMap application powered by **vue**, **antvis/X6** and **element**. This app is a pure web page without any backend for data interactions. Thus, it's **convenient** to build your own mindmap app.

Inspired by **XMind**, I designed the MindBox with many necessary and useful Features as follows:

- create child node
- create sibling node
- layout 
- note node
- upload to your gitee repo
- file manager (open an online file)
- ...

You can config your gitee options in `src/index.js`.

Here is a [demo](http://wykxldz.gitee.io/mindbox/?u=WYKXLDZ&r=MindBoxCollection&s=3746793b39d93d69f05aaac9ac39035ec3ae5544&n=Demo.mb) without gitee storage.

Enjoy it!
